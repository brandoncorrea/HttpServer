A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....

[Opens on a shot of a planet which pans up to a view of planetary rings with a small ship flying through them. Switches to a shot of the planet Lah’mu and the ship flying through the rings. A shot of the planet closer up with the ship flying towards the surface. The ship flies down across a farm and passes by a white worker droid, who watches the ship. Cuts to a young Jyn Erso running across the rocky plain with the ship following behind her.]



INT. ERSO HOMESTEAD (Inside the Erso homestead)

YOUNG JYN ERSO: Mama.


LYRA ERSO: We know. Jyn, gather your things, it’s time.

(The ship lands near the Erso homestead.)

SAW GERRERA: Hello.


LYRA ERSO: Saw, it’s Lyra.It’s happened. He’s come for us.


SAW GERRERA: You know what to do.


GALEN ERSO: Jyn, come here. Remember, whatever I do, I do it to protect you. Say you understand.


YOUNG JYN ERSO: I understand.


GALEN ERSO: I love you, Stardust.


YOUNG JYN ERSO: I love you too, Papa.


LYRA ERSO: Galen.


GALEN ERSO: Go.


EXT. ERSO HOMESTEAD (Outside the home)

LYRA ERSO: Jyn.You know where to go, don’t you? Trust the Force.

(In front of the Erso home stands Director Orson Krennic flanked by Deathtroopers. Galen confronts Krennic.)

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: You’re a hard man to find, Galen. But farming? Really, a man of your talents?


GALEN ERSO: It’s a peaceful life.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: It’s lonely, I imagine.


GALEN ERSO: Since Lyra died, yes.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Oh. Oh. My condolences. Search the house!


DEATHTROOPER: Understood.


GALEN ERSO: What is it you want?


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: The work has stalled, I need you to come back.


GALEN ERSO: I won’t do it, Krennic.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: We’re on the verge of greatness. We were this close to providing peace, security for the galaxy.


GALEN ERSO: You’re confusing peace with terror.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Do I, huh? You have to start somewhere.


GALEN ERSO: I’ll be of no help, Krennic. My mind just isn’t what it was. I have trouble remembering, even simple things.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Galen, you’re an inspired scientist but you’re a terrible liar. Now I admire the effort, I really do.

(Lyra emerges from the grass holding a blaster.)

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Oh look, here’s Lyra back from the dead. It’s a miracle.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Stop!


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Oh, Lyra. Troublesome as ever.


LYRA ERSO: You’re not taking him.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: No, of course I’m not. I’m taking you all. You’ll all come. You, your child, You’ll all live in comfort.


LYRA ERSO: As hostages.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: As ‘heroes of the Empire.’


GALEN ERSO: Lyra. Put it down. Think very carefully.


LYRA ERSO: You will never win.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Do it.

(A deathtrooper shoots Lyra right as she hits Krennic in the shoulder. Lyra falls down dead.)

GALEN ERSO: Lyra! No!


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: They have a child. Find it!

(Deathtroopers march off to find Jyn)

(Jyn hides in a cave a climbs into a secret hatch)

(Later, the hatch is opened. Jyn sees the face of Saw Gerrera.)

SAW GERRERA: My child. Come. Come. We have a long ride ahead of us.


ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY


RING OF KAFRENE: TRADING OUTPOST

STORMTROOPER: Check in, security. Cell block 4227. 4227.

Cassian Andor pushes through the crowd and then ducks into an alleyway where he meets Tivik, an informant.

TIVIK: I was about to leave.


CASSIAN ANDOR: I came as fast as I could.


TIVIK: I have to get back on board. Walk with me.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Back to Jedha?


TIVIK: They’ll leave without me!


CASSIAN ANDOR: Easy. You have news from Jedha? Come on.


TIVIK: An Imperial pilot, one of the cargo drivers. He defected yesterday. He’s telling people they’re making a weapon. The kyber crystals, that’s what they’re for.


CASSIAN ANDOR: What kind of weapon?


TIVIK: Look, I have to go.


CASSIAN ANDOR: What kind of weapon?


TIVIK: A planet killer. That’s what he called it.


CASSIAN ANDOR: A planet killer?


TIVIK: Someone named Erso sent him. Some old friend of Saw’s.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Galen Erso? Was it?


TIVIK: I don’t know! They were looking for Saw when we left.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Who else knows this?


TIVIK: I have no idea! It’s all falling apart. Saw’s right, there’re spies everywhere.

A stormtrooper appears in the alleyway

STORMTROOPER: What’s all this?


STORMTROOPER: Come on, let’s see some scandocs.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Yeah, of course. My gloves?

Cassian pulls a blaster and kills the stormtroopers.

TIVIK: No, What’ve you done?


STORMTROOPER: Troopers down, section 9.


TIVIK: Are you crazy? I’ll never climb out of here. My arm...


STORMTROOPER: Get out of the way. Move! Move!


CASSIAN ANDOR: Calm down. Calm down. We’ll be all right.

Cassian shoots Tivik in the back.


JEDHA: IMPERIAL OCCUPIED MOON

MILITIA: (Sir.)

The Militia pulls a bag off of the head of Bodhi Rook, a defected Imperial Pilot.

BODHI ROOK: Is that him? He looks kind of different than I imagined.


MILITIA: (On your feet! It’s the pilot, the defector)


BODHI ROOK: Okay, so you’re--you’re Saw Gerrera? Saw Gerrera. No? Okay, we’re just wasting time that we don’t have. I need to speak to Saw Gerrera! I keep telling them before, before it’s too late.


EDRIO TWO TUBES: (Keep your heads down! The Imperials will be searching for him…)


BODHI ROOK: We’re out here in the middle of nowhere. We need to get to Jedha City. What part of urgent message do you guys not understand? Hey! we’re all on the same side, if you just see past the uniform for a minute. I’ve got to speak to ah... I’ve got to speak to Saw Gerrera.


WOBANI: IMPERIAL LABOR CAMP


INT. TRANSPORT (Inside a transport)

The transport suddenly stops.

STORMTROOPER: What now?


STORMTROOPER: I don’t know. Must be another pick up.


STORMTROOPER: I thought we had everybody.

The door to the transport bursts open and Rebel Alliance soldiers file in.

SOLDIER: All clear, sir.


SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: Hallik! Liana Hallik!


SOLDIER: Her.


SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: You want to get out of here?


PRISONER: Hey! What about me?

Jyn kicks the Rebel and begins to run from the transport.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: [chokeslamming Jyn for trying to escape] Congratulations.You are being rescued. Please do not resist.


YAVIN 4: REBEL BASE

PA: LU-28, report to maintenance level 4.


INT. MASSASSII REBEL BASE (Inside the temple)

GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: You’re currently calling yourself Liana Hallik. Is that correct? Possession of unsanctioned weapons, forgery of Imperial documents, aggravated assault,escape from custody, resisting arrest. Imagine if the Imperial authorities had found out who you really were. Jyn Erso? That’s your given name, is it not? Jyn Erso? Daughter of Galen Erso. A known Imperial collaborator in weapons development.


JYN ERSO: What is this?


SENATOR MON MOTHMA: It’s a chance for you to make a fresh start.


CASSIAN ANDOR: We think you might be able to help us.


SENATOR MON MOTHMA: This is Captain Cassian Andor, Rebel Intelligence.


CASSIAN ANDOR: When was the last time you were in contact with your father?


JYN ERSO: 15 years ago.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Any idea where he’s been all that time?


JYN ERSO: I like to think he’s dead, makes things easier.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Easier than what? That he’s being a tool of the Imperial war machine?


JYN ERSO: I’ve never had the luxury of political opinions.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Really? When was your last contact with Saw Gerrera?


JYN ERSO: It’s been a long time.


CASSIAN ANDOR: He’d remember you, though, wouldn’t he? He might agree to meet you, if you came as a friend.


GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: We’re up against the clock here, girl, So if there’s nothing to talk about, we’ll just put you back where we found you.


JYN ERSO: I was a child, Saw Gerrera saved my life. He raised me. But I’ve no idea where he is. I haven’t seen him in years.


CASSIAN ANDOR: We know how to find him, that’s not our problem. What we need is someone who gets us through the door without being killed.


JYN ERSO: You’re all rebels, aren’t you?


SENATOR MON MOTHMA: Yes, but Saw Gerrera’s an extremist. He’s been fighting on his own since he broke with the Rebellion. His militancy has caused the Alliance a great many problems. We have no choice now but to try to mend that broken trust.


JYN ERSO: What does this have to do with my father?


CASSIAN ANDOR: There’s an Imperial defector in Jedha. A pilot. He’s being held by Saw Gerrera. He’s claiming the Emperor is creating a weapon with the power to destroy entire planets. The pilot says he was sent by your father.


SENATOR MON MOTHMA: We need to stop this weapon before it is finished.


GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Captain Andor’s mission is to authenticate the pilot’s story and then, if possible, find your father.


SENATOR MON MOTHMA: It appears he is critical to the development of this superweapon. Given the gravity of the situation and your history with Saw,we’re hoping that he will help us locate your father and return him to the Senate for testimony.


JYN ERSO: And if I do it?


SENATOR MON MOTHMA: We’ll make sure you go free.


EXT. MASSASSII REBEL BASE (Outside the temple)

GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Captain Andor!


INT. U-WING (Inside a U-Wing)

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I’m K-2SO. I’m a reprogrammed Imperial droid.


JYN ERSO: I remember you.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I see the Council is sending you with us to Jedha.


JYN ERSO: Apparently so.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: That is a bad idea. I think so, and so does Cassian. What do I know? My specialty is just strategic analysis.


(Outside the ship)

GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Galen Erso is vital to the Empire’s weapon program. Forget what you heard in there, there will be no extraction. You find him, you kill him. Then and there.


INT. U-WING (Inside the U-Wing)

CASSIAN ANDOR: You met Kay-Tu?


JYN ERSO: Charming.


CASSIAN ANDOR: He tends to say whatever comes into his circuits. It’s a by-product of the reprogram.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Why does she get a blaster, and I don’t?


CASSIAN ANDOR: What?


JYN ERSO: I know how to use it.


CASSIAN ANDOR: That’s what I’m afraid of. Give it to me.


JYN ERSO: We’re going to Jedha. That’s a war zone.


CASSIAN ANDOR: That’s not the point. Where did you get it?


JYN ERSO: I found it.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I find that answer vague and unconvincing.


JYN ERSO: Trust goes both ways.

Cassian hops into the pilot seat


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: You’re letting her keep it? Would you like to know the probability of her using it against you? It’s high.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Let’s get going.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: It’s very high.


(Partisan base on Jedha)

SAW GERRERA: Lies! Deceptions! Let’s see it. Bodhi Rook. Cargo pilot. Local boy, huh?


BODHI ROOK: Uh-huh.


EDRIO TWO TUBES: (This was found in his boot when he was captured)


BODHI ROOK: Okay, I can hear you. He didn’t capture me, I came here myself. I defected, I defected.


SAW GERRERA: Every day, more lies.


BODHI ROOK: Lies? Would I risk everything for a lie? No, we don’t have time for this! I have to speak to Saw Gerrera before it’s too late.

The sack is pulled off of Bodhi’s head.


BODHI ROOK: Okay... So, you... Um. Uh.That’s-That’s for you. And I gave it to them, they did not find it! I gave it to them. Galen Erso. He told me to find you.


SAW GERRERA: Bor Gullet.


BODHI ROOK: Bor Gullet? Galen Erso sent me! He told me to find you!


INT. STAR DESTROYER "EXECUTRIX" - BRIDGE (On the bridge of a Star Destroyer overlooking the construction of the Death Star.)

GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: Most unfortunate about the security breach on Jedha, Director Krennic. After so many setbacks and delays, and now this. We’ve heard word of rumors circulating through the city. Apparently you’ve lost a rather talkative cargo pilot. If the Senate gets wind of our project, countless systems will flock to the Rebellion.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: When the battle station is finished, Governor Tarkin, the Senate will be of little concern.


GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: When has become now, Director Krennic. The Emperor will tolerate no further delay, you have made time an ally of the Rebellion. I suggest, we solve both problems simultaneously with an immediate test of the weapon. Failure will find you explaining why to a far less patient audience.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: I will not fail.

Tarkin watches the superlaser being set into place, completing the Death Star.


Inside Jyn’s dream, she sees herself as a little girl.

GALEN ERSO: What’s the matter, Jyn? You looked frightened. I’ll always protect you. Stardust. Don’t ever change.


LYRA ERSON: Trust...


LYRA ERSO: Galen.

Jyn wakes up

CASSIAN ANDOR: We’re coming into orbit.You have controls.

The U-Wing lands in front of a view of the Holy City of Jedha with a Star Destroyer hovering over. Multiple smaller shuttles are going back and forth between the destroyer and the city.

CASSIAN ANDOR: That’s Jedha. Or what’s left of it. We find Saw, we find your father.


JYN ERSO: What’s with the Destroyer?


CASSIAN ANDOR: It’s because of your old friend, Saw Gerrera. He’s been attacking the cargo shipments.


JYN ERSO: What are they bringing in?


CASSIAN ANDOR: It’s ‘what are they taking out?’ Kyber crystal. All they can get. We wondered why they were stripping the temple, now we know.It’s the fuel for the weapon.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: The weapon your father’s building.


JYN ERSO: Maybe we should leave target practice behind.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Are you talking about me?


CASSIAN ANDOR: She’s right. We need to blend in. Stay with the ship.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I can blend in. I’m an Imperial droid. This city is under Imperial occupation.


JYN ERSO: Half the people here want to reprogram you. The other half want to put a hole in your head.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I’m surprised you’re so concerned with my safety.


JYN ERSO: I’m not. I’m just worried they might miss you and hit me.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Doesn’t sound so bad to me.


INT. PARTISAN BASE (In the Partisan base.)

Bodhi is strapped to a chair. A strange bloblike alien with long tentacles emerges from the darkness.

SAW GERRERA: Bor Gullet can feel your thoughts, No lie is safe. What have you really brought me, cargo pilot? Bor Gullet will know the truth. The unfortunate side effect, is that one tends to lose one’s mind. Bor Gullet’s tentacles begin to wrap around Bodhi and stroke his head, reaching into his thoughts.


BODHI ROOK: No.


(In the Holy City of Jedha)

Cassian and Jyn walk through a crowd. Jyn bumps into Dr. Evazan and Ponda Baba.

DR. CORNELIUS EVAZAN: Hey, you just watch yourself.


CASSIAN ANDOR: No, no.Tourist, we don’t want any trouble, sorry. Come on. Come on.


STORMTROOPER: Citizens of Jedha, you must come forward with information of the location of this missing cargo pilot. A reward of 600 credits for the information shall be awarded.


CASSIAN ANDOR: I had a contact, one of Saw’s rebels, but he’s just gone missing.His sister will be looking for him. The temple’s been destroyed but she’ll be there waiting. We’ll give her your name and hope that gets us a meeting with Saw.


JYN ERSO: Hope?


CASSIAN ANDOR: Yeah. Rebellions are built on hope.


STORMTROOPER: (To a citizen of Jedha City) Hands where I can see them. Get over there. Show me some identification. Check inside.


JYN ERSO: Is this all because of your pilot? She notices Chirrut Imwe sitting beside the street.


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: May the Force of others be with you. May the Force of others be with you.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Wait for me. Cassian leaves.


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: May the Force of others be with you. May the Force of others be with you.


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: (To Jyn) Would you trade that necklace for a glimpse into your future? Yes, I’m speaking to you. I am Chirrut Îmwe.


JYN ERSO: How did you know I was wearing a necklace?


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: For that answer you must pay. What do you know of kyber crystals?


JYN ERSO: My father, he said they powered the Jedi lightsabers. Cassian returns.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Jyn. Come on, let’s go.


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: The strongest stars have hearts of kyber.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Let’s go. We’re not here to make friends.


JYN ERSO: Who are they?


CASSIAN ANDOR: The Guardians of the Whills. Protectors of the Kyber Temple. But there’s nothing left to protect, so now they’re just causing trouble for everybody.


JYN ERSO: You seem awfully tense all of a sudden.


CASSIAN ANDOR: We have to hurry. This town, it’s ready to blow.


STORMTROOPER: Citizens of the Empire, Imperial forces...

The stormtrooper tank explodes and Partisans begin fighting the stormtroopers.

JYN ERSO: Tell me you have a backup plan.


STORMTROOPER: Incoming.


STORMTROOPER: Put your guns down.


STORMTROOPER: Behind us.


JYN ERSO: Looks like we found Saw’s rebels.

Jyn sees a small child standing in the danger, crying. She runs to save her.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Jyn, no!

The child’s mother quickly arrives and takes her daughter.

MOTHER: Thank you.


STORMTROOPER: Hit the tower.


CITIZEN: Get out of there!


CITIZEN: Quickly, the kyber, get it. Here, take the kyber. Take the kyber. Come on!


CASSIAN ANDOR: This way!

They are surprised by an Imperial droid that looks exactly like K-2SO. Jyn shoots it and it falls to the ground. K-2SO walks out from behind it.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Did you know that wasn’t me?


JYN ERSO: Of course!


CASSIAN ANDOR: I thought I told you to stay on the ship.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: You did, but I thought it was boring, and you were in trouble. There are a lot of explosions for two people blending in.

A grenade sails towards K-2SO and he catches it without looking and throws it backwards towards a group of stormtroopers.

STORMTROOPER: Freeze right there...

The grenade explodes, killing the entire squad of stormtroopers.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: You’re right, I should just wait on the ship.

Cassian, Jyn and K-2SO walk into a clearing with multiple stormtroopers.

STORMTROOPER: Halt! Stop right there!


STORMTROOPER: Where are you taking these prisoners?


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: These are prisoners.


STORMTROOPER: Yes. Where are you taking them?


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I am taking them... to imprison them. In prison.


CASSIAN ANDOR: He’s taking us to...

K-2SO slaps Cassian.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Quiet! And there’s a fresh one if you mouth off again!


STORMTROOPER: We’ll take them from here.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: That’s okay. If you could just point me in the right direction, I can take them, I’m sure. I’ve taken them this far…


CASSIAN ANDOR: Hey, wait a second.


STORMTROOPER: Take them away.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Wait!


STORMTROOPER: Hey, droid. You can’t take them away! You stay here. We need to check your diagnostics.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Diagnostics? I’m capable of running my own diagnostics, thank you very much.

Chirrut emerges from a doorway.

CHIRRUT ÎMWE: Let them pass in peace! Let them pass in peace. The Force is with me, and I am with the Force. And I fear nothing, for all is as the Force wills it.


STORMTROOPER: Hey! Stop right there!


STORMTROOPER: He’s blind.


STORMTROOPER: Is he deaf?


STORMTROOPER: I said: Stop right there!

Chirrut stops. Listening closely to the stormtroopers’ movements. At the right moment, he springs into action, easily beating up the stormtroopers.

CHIRRUT ÎMWE: Is your foot all right?

Chirrut knocks down the last stormtrooper, but many more surround him. Suddenly, rapid blaster fire kills all the stormtroopers. The blaster fire has come from Chirrut’s friend, Baze Malbus.

CHIRRUT ÎMWE: You almost shot me.


BAZE MALBUS: You’re welcome.

Cassian, Jyn and K-2SO emerge from a hiding spot.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Clear of hostiles!

Baze aims his blaster at K-2SO

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: One hostile!


JYN ERSO: He’s with us!


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: They’re all right.


JYN ERSO: Thanks.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Cassian, I’m sorry about the slap.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Go back to the ship. Wait for my call. 


CASSIAN ANDOR: Is he a Jedi?


BAZE MALBUS: There are no Jedi here anymore. Only dreamers like this fool.


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: The Force did protect me.


BAZE ÎMWE: I protected you.


JYN ERSO: Can you get us to Saw Gerrera?


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: Can’t you see we are no friends of the Empire?

The Partisans suddenly surround the group

EDRIO TWO TUBES: (Tell that to the one who killed our men.)


JYN ERSO: Anyone who kills me or my friends will answer to Saw Gerrera.


EDRIO TWO TUBES: (And why Is that?)


JYN ERSO: Because I am the daughter of Galen Erso.


EDRIO TWO TUBES: (Take them!)

Sacks are put over everyone’s heads.

CHIRRUT ÎMWE: Are you kidding me? I’m blind!

INT. PARTISAN BASE (Inside the prison cells in the Partisan base.)

CHIRRUT ÎMWE: I’m one with the Force and the Force is with me. I’m one with the Force and the Force is with me.


BAZE MALBUS: You pray?


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: I’m one with the Force and the Force is with me.


BAZE MALBUS: Really?


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: I’m one with the Force and the Force is with me.


BAZE MALBUS: He’s praying for the door to open.


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: It bothers him, because he knows it is possible. Baze Malbus was once the most devoted Guardian of us all.


CASSIAN ANDOR: I’m beginning to think the Force and I have different priorities.


BAZE MALBUS: Relax, Captain. We’ve been in worse cages than this one.


CASSIAN ANDOR: This is a first for me.


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: There is more than one sort of prison, Captain, I sense that you carry yours wherever you go.

(Outside of the prison cells)

SAW GERRERA: Jyn. Is it really you? I can’t believe it.


JYN ERSO: Must be quite a surprise.


SAW GERRERA: Are we not still friends?


JYN ERSO: The last time I saw you, you gave me a knife and loaded blaster and told me to wait in a bunker until daylight.


SAW GERRERA: I knew you were safe.


JYN ERSO: You left me behind.


SAW GERRERA: You were already the best soldier in my cadre.


JYN ERSO: I was sixteen.


SAW GERRERA: I was protecting you!


JYN ERSO: You dumped me!


SAW GERRERA: You were the daughter of an Imperial science officer! People were starting to figure that out. People who wanted to- to use you as a hostage. Not a day goes by that I don’t think of you. But today, of all days? It’s a trap, isn’t it?


JYN ERSO: What?


SAW GERRERA: The pilot! The message. All of it. Did they... send you? Did you come here to kill me? There’s not much of me left.


JYN ERSO: The Alliance wants my father.They think he’s sent you a message about a weapon. I guess they think by sending me you might actually help them out.


SAW GERRERA: So what is it that you want, Jyn?


JYN ERSO: They wanted an introduction, they’ve got it. I’m out now. The rest of you can do what you want.


SAW GERRERA: You care not about the cause?


JYN ERSO: The cause? Seriously? The Alliance? The...The rebels? Whatever it is you’re calling yourself these days? All it’s ever brought me is pain.


SAW GERRERA: You can stand to see the Imperial flag reign across the galaxy?


JYN ERSO: It’s not a problem if you don’t look up.


SAW GERRERA: I have something to show you, come.

INT. DEATH STAR (On the Death Star)

GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: The Emperor is awaiting my report.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: One had hoped that he and Lord Vader might have been here for such an occasion.


GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: And I thought it prudent to save you from any potential embarrassment.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Your concern is hardly warranted.


GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: If saying it would only make it so.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: All Imperial forces, have been evacuated, and I stand ready to destroy the entire moon.


GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: That won’t be necessary. We need a statement, not a manifesto. The Holy City will be enough for the day.

KRENNIC: Target Jedha City, prepare single reactor ignition.


CAPTAIN DUNSTIG PTERRO: Sir, we’re in position, ready to...


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Fire!


CAPTAIN DUNSTIG PTERRO: Commence primary ignition.

INT. PARTISAN BASE (In the Partisan prison)

CHIRRUT ÎMWE: Who’s the one in the next cell?


CASSIAN ANDOR: What? Where?

Baze looks through the hole in the wall and sees Bodhi

BAZE MALBUS: An Imperial pilot.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Pilot?


BAZE MALBUS: I’m going to kill him!


CASSIAN ANDOR: No, no, No, wait!


BAZE MALBUS: Come here!


CASSIAN ANDOR: NO!


BAZE MALBUS: Back off. Back off.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Okay.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Are you the pilot? Hey, hey are you the pilot? The shuttle pilot? Pilot?


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: What’s wrong with him?


CASSIAN ANDOR: Galen Erso. You know that name?


BODHI ROOK: I brought the message, I’m the pilot. I’m the pilot. I’m the pilot.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Okay, good. Now where is Galen Erso?

INT. DEATH STAR (On the Death Star)

GUNNER: Standby.

INT. PARTISAN BASE (In the Partisan base)

SAW GERRERA: This is the message I was sent.

The holoprojector lights up and a hologram of Galen Erso appears.

GALEN ERSO: Saw, if you’re watching this, then perhaps there is a chance to save the Alliance. Perhaps there’s a chance to explain myself and, though I don’t dare hope for too much, a chance for Jyn, if she’s alive, if you can possibly find her to let her know that my love for her has never faded and how desperately I’ve missed her. Jyn, my Stardust, I can’t imagine what you think of me. When I was taken, I faced some bitter truths. I was told that, soon enough, Krennic would have you as well. As time went by, I knew that you were either dead or so well hidden that he would never find you. I knew if I refused to work, if I took my own life, it would only be a matter of time before Krennic realized he no longer needed me to complete the project. So I did the one thing that nobody expected: I lied. I learned to lie. I played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work. I made myself indispensable, and all the while I laid the groundwork of my revenge. We call it the Death Star. There is no better name. And the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed. I’ve placed a weakness deep within the system. A flaw so small and powerful, they’ll never find it. But, Jyn. Jyn, if you’re listening My beloved, so much of my life has been wasted. I try to think of you only in the moments when I’m strong, because the pain of not having you with me Your mother. Our family. The pain of that loss is so overwhelming I risk failing even now. It’s just so hard not to think of you. Think of where you are. My Stardust. Saw, the reactor module, that’s the key. That’s the place I’ve laid my trap. It’s well hidden and unstable, one blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station.

The Death Star blasts the Holy City of Jedha, vaporizing it in an instant.

GALEN ERSO: You’ll need the plans, the structural plans for the Death Star to find the reactor. I know there’s a complete engineering archive in the data vault at the Citadel Tower on Scarif. Any pressurized explosion to the reactor module will set off a chain reaction that will destroy the entire station...

The hologram cuts off because of the earthquake going through the Partisan base due to the Death Star’s fire.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Go. Go.


CASSIAN ANDOR: (Over the comms) K-2? K-2, where are you?


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: There you are. I’m standing by as you requested. Although there’s a problem on the horizon. There is no horizon.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Locate our position. Bring that ship in here now!


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: Where are you going?


CASSIAN ANDOR: I’ve got to find Jyn. Get the pilot. We need him.


BAZE MALBUS: All right. I’ll get the pilot.


BAZE MALBUS: Pilot.

He aims his blaster at Bodhi

BODHI ROOK: No, no, no.

He fires but the blaster hits the cell door, freeing Bodhi.

BAZE MALBUS: Let’s go.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Jyn! We’ve got to go. I know where your father is.


SAW GERRERA: Go with him, Jyn. You must go.


JYN ERSO: Come with us.


SAW GERRERA: I will run no longer.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Come on.


JYN ERSO: But you must save yourself.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Come on.


SAW GERRERA: Go! There’s no time! Save the Rebellion! Save the dream!

INT. DEATH STAR (On the Death Star)

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Oh. It’s beautiful.

EXT. PARTISAN BASE (Outside the Partisan base)

BAZE MALBUS: Chirrut, let’s go!


CASSIAN: [to Bodhi] Come on! Let’s get out of here!

They all pile into the U-Wing.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Get us out of here! Punch it!


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I’m not very optimistic about our odds.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Let’s not, K. Come on! Punch it.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I haven’t completed my calculation.


CASSIAN ANDOR: I’ll make them for you.

The U-Wing shifts into hyperspace and zips away from Jedha.

INT. DEATH STAR (On the Death Star)

GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: I believe I owe you an apology, Director Krennic. Your work exceeds all expectations.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: And you’ll tell the Emperor as much?


GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: I will tell him his patience with your misadventures has been rewarded with a weapon that will bring a swift end to the Rebellion.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: That was only an inkling of it’s destructive potential.



GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: I will tell him, that I will be taking control over the weapon I first spoke of years ago effective immediately.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: We stand here amid my achievement not yours!


GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: I’m afraid these recent security breaches have laid bare your inadequacies as a military director.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: The breaches have been filled, Jedha has been silenced.


GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: You think this pilot acted alone? He was dispatched from the installation on Eadu. Galen Erso’s facility.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: We’ll see about this.

INT. MASSASSII REBEL BASE (In the Rebel base on Yavin 4)

REBEL: A coded message from Captain Andor, sir. Weapon confirmed. Jedha destroyed. Mission target located on Eadu. Please advise.


GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Destroyed? Proceed. Tell him my orders still stand. Tell him to proceed with haste and keep to the plan. We have no idea what he is building for the Empire. We have to kill Galen Erso while we have the chance.

INT. U-WING (In hyperspace, in the U-Wing.)

CHIRRUT ÎMWE: Baze, tell me. All of it? The whole city? Tell me.


BODHI ROOK: All of it.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Understood. Set a course for Eadu.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Setting course for Eadu.


JYN ERSO: Is that where my father is?


CASSIAN ANDOR: I think so.


BODHI ROOK: So you’re Galen’s daughter.


JYN ERSO: You know him?


BODHI ROOK: I’m Bodhi, the pilot.


JYN ERSO: You brought the message.


BODHI ROOK: Yes, your father... He said I could get right by myself.He said I could make it right, if I was brave enough and listened to what was in my heart. Do something about it. Guess it was too late.


JYN ERSO: It wasn’t too late.


BODHI ROOK: Seems pretty late to me.


JYN ERSO: No. We can beat the people who did this. My father’s message, I’ve seen it.They call it the Death Star. But they have no idea there’s a way to defeat it. You’re wrong about my father.


CASSIAN ANDOR: He did build it.


JYN ERSO: Because he knew they’d do it without him. My father made a choice. He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion. He’s rigged a trap inside it. That’s why he sent you. To bring that message.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Where is it? Where’s the message?


JYN ERSO: It was a hologram.


CASSIAN ANDOR: You have that message, right?


JYN ERSO: Everything happened so fast.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Did you see it?


JYN ERSO: You don’t believe me.


CASSIAN ANDOR: I’m not the one you’ve got to convince.


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: I believe her.


CASSIAN ANDOR: That’s good to know.


BAZE MALBUS:What kind of trap? You said your father made a trap.


JYN ERSO: The reactor. He’s placed a weakness there. He’s been hiding it for years. He said if you can blow the reactor- the module- the whole system goes down. You need to send word to the Alliance.


CASSIAN ANDOR: I’ve done that.


JYN ERSO: They have to know there’s a way to destroy this thing. They have to go to Scarif to get the plans.


CASSIAN ANDOR: I can’t risk sending that. We’re in the heart of Imperial territory.


JYN ERSO: Then we’ll find him. And bring him back, and he can tell them himself.

INT. DEATH STAR (On the Death Star)

CAPTAIN DUNSTIG PTERRO: Course set for Eadu, sir.

EADU: IMPERIAL RESEARCH FACILITY

The U-Wing flies carefully through the rainy, dark canyons of Eadu.

CHIRRUT ÎMWE: I’m one with the Force and the Force is with me.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: 20 degrees to the right. 10 degrees up.


BODHI ROOK: No, no, no, lower. Lower!


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Are you sure this is the way?


BODHI ROOK: They have landing trackers. They have patrol squadrons. You’ve got to stay in the canyon, keep it low.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Watch your right!


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: There’s a 26% chance of failure.


CASSIAN ANDOR: How much farther?


BODHI ROOK: I don’t know. I’m not sure, I never really come this way, but we’re close, we’re close. I know that.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Well, now there’s a 35% chance of failure.


BODHI ROOK: I don’t want to know, thank you.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I understand.


BODHI ROOK: Now! Put it down now!


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: The wind...


BODHI ROOK: If you keep going, you’ll be right over the shuttle depot. Watch out!

The U-Wing hits its engine on a rock and the ship begins to fall.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Hey!


CASSIAN ANDOR: Hold on tight! We’re coming down hard!

INT. MASSASSII REBEL BASE (On Yavin 4)

GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Try them again.


REBEL: I am, sir. We... The signal’s gone dead.


GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Squadron up, target Eadu.

EADU (On Eadu)

BODHI ROOK: How about now, check stabilizers?


CASSIAN ANDOR: Bodhi, where’s the lab?


BODHI ROOK: The research facility?


CASSIAN ANDOR: Yeah. Where is it?


BODHI ROOK: It’s just over the ridge.


CASSIAN ANDOR: And that’s a shuttle depot straight ahead of us? You are sure of that?


BODHI ROOK: Yes. We’ll have to hope there’s still an Imperial ship left to steal.



CASSIAN ANDOR: Here’s what we’re doing. Hopefully, the storm keeps up and keeps us hidden down here. Bodhi, you’re coming with me. We’ll go up the ridge and check it out.


JYN ERSO: I’m coming with you.


CASSIAN ANDOR: No, your father’s message, we can’t risk it. You’re the messenger.


JYN ERSO: That’s ridiculous. We all got the message.Everyone here knows it.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: One blast to the reactor module and the whole system goes down. That’s how you said it. The whole system goes down.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Get to work fixing our comms! All I want to do right now is get a handle on what we’re up against.So, we’re going to go very small and very carefully up the rise and see what’s what. Let’s get out of here.


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: Does he look like a killer?


BAZE MALBUS: No. He has the face of a friend.


JYN ERSO: Who are you talking about?


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: Captain Andor.


JYN ERSO: Why do you ask that? What do you mean, does he look like a killer?


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: The Force moves darkly near a creature that’s about to kill.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: His weapon was in the sniper configuration.

EXT. ROCKY RIDGE (On a rocky ridge.)

BODHI ROOK: No, no, no... We got to go up. You can’t see much from down there. This way.


CASSIAN ANDOR: I’ll be right behind you. Come on.

INT. U-WING (In the crashed U-Wing.)

BAZE MALBUS: Where are you going?


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: I’m going to follow Jyn. Her path is clear.


BAZE MALBUS: Alone? Good luck!


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: I don’t need luck, I have you!


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: What are they doing? If Cassian comes back, we’re leaving without them.

EXT. IMPERIAL RESEARCH FACILITY - RIDGE OVERLOOK (On a ridge overlooking the Imperial Research Facility.)

CASSIAN ANDOR: You see Erso out there?


BAZE MALBUS: We’ve come too far.


CHIRRUT ÎMWE: Patience, my friend.


BODHI ROOK: That’s him. That’s him, Galen, in the dark suit.


CASSIAN ANDOR: Get back down there, and find us a ride out of here.


BODHI ROOK: What are you doing?


CASSIAN ANDOR: You heard me.


BODHI ROOK: You said we came up here just to have a look.


CASSIAN ANDOR: I’m here, I’m looking. Go. Hurry!

EXT. IMPERIAL RESEARCH FACILITY - LANDING PLATFORM (On the landing platform in front of the research facility.)

Krennic’s ship is landed and he walks out, flanked by deathtroopers, towards a group.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Excellent news, Galen. The battle station is complete. You must be very proud.


GALEN ERSO: Proud as I can be, Krennic.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Gather your engineers, I have an announcement. Is that all of them?


GALEN ERSO: Yes.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Gentlemen. One of you betrayed the Empire. One of you has conspired with a pilot to send messages to the Rebellion. And I urge that traitor step forward.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Very well, I’ll consider it a group effort, then. Ready!


ENGINEER: No.


ENGINEER: No, please.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Aim... and...


ENGINEER: No, no.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: fire!


GALEN ERSO: Stop! Stop! Krennic, stop. It was me. It was me. They have nothing to do with it. Spare them.


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Fire!


DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: How do I know the weapon is complete?


GALEN ERSO: Let me share with you some details.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Cassian. Cassian, can you hear me?

CASSIAN ANDOR: I’m here. You got it working.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Affirmative yes, although we have a problem! There’s an Alliance squadron approaching.

REBEL PILOT: Clear the area!

CASSIAN ANDOR: No. No, no, no! Tell them to hold up! Jyn’s on that platform!

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Jedha. Saw Gerrera. His band of fanatics. Their Holy City. The last reminder of the Jedi. Gone.

GALEN ERSO: You’ll never win.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Now where have I heard that before?

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Relay from Captain Andor.

REBEL: General.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Captain Andor requesting a delay on squadron support. Alliance forces onsite.Please confirm.

GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Get the squadron leader on, Get him on now!

REBEL: They’re already engaged, sir.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Dead. No.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Return fire! To your stations. Get our fighters in the air now!

JYN ERSO: Father!

STORMTROOPER: Go, go, go, go.

STORMTROOPER: Fall back! Fall back!

CAPTAIN DUNSTIG PTERRO: Director, we need to evacuate.

JYN ERSO: Papa. Papa, it’s me. It’s Jyn.

GALEN ERSO: Jyn. Stardust.

JYN ERSO: Papa. I’ve seen your message. The hologram, I’ve seen it.

GALEN ERSO: It must be destroyed.

JYN ERSO: I know. I know. We will.

GALEN ERSO: Jyn. Look at you. I’ve so much to tell you.

JYN ERSO: Papa. No. No. Papa! Papa! Come on.

STORMTROOPER: Over there, take them down.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Come on. Jyn, we’ve got to go. Come on.

JYN ERSO: I can’t leave him.  CASSIAN ANDOR: Listen to me. He’s gone. There’s nothing you can do. Come on.

JYN ERSO: I can’t leave him.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Come on! Help me. Move!

CASSIAN ANDOR: Down!

CASSIAN ANDOR: Come on. Come on.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Well done. You’re a Rebel now.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Let’s go, let’s go. Come on, let’s move! Come on, let’s get out of here. Move, move, move. Okay, K-2, let’s go.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Copy that.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Ion thrusters low until we cleared the storm.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Understood.

JYN ERSO: You lied to me.

CASSIAN ANDOR: You’re in shock.

JYN ERSO: You went up there to kill my father.

CASSIAN ANDOR: You don’t know what you’re talking about.

JYN ERSO: Deny it.

CASSIAN ANDOR: You’re in shock, and looking for someplace to put it.

JYN ERSO: I’ve seen it before.

CASSIAN ANDOR: I bet you have.

JYN ERSO: They know.You lied about why we came here and you lied about why you went up alone.

CASSIAN ANDOR: I had every chance to pull the trigger. But did I? Did I?

JYN ERSO: You might as well have. My father was living proof and you put him at risk. Those were Alliance bombs that killed him!

CASSIAN ANDOR: I had orders! Orders that I disobeyed! But you wouldn’t understand that.

JYN ERSO: Orders? When you know they’re wrong? You might as well be a stormtrooper.

CASSIAN ANDOR: What do you know? We don’t all have the luxury of deciding when and where we want to care about something. Suddenly the Rebellion is real for you? Some of us live it. I’ve been in this fight since I was 6 years old. You’re not the only one who lost everything. Some of us just decided to do something about it.

JYN ERSO: You can’t talk your way around this.

CASSIAN ANDOR: I don’t have to. Yavin Four! Make sure they know we’re coming in with a stolen ship. Anybody else? VANEE: My lord, Director Krennic has arrived.

DARTH VADER: Director Krennic.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Lord Vader.

DARTH VADER: You seem unsettled.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: No. Just pressed for time. There’re a great many things to attend to.

DARTH VADER: My apologies. You do have a great many things to explain.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: I’ve delivered the weapon the Emperor requested. I deserve an audience to make certain he understands its remarkable… potential.

DARTH VADER: Its power to create problems has certainly been confirmed. A city destroyed. An Imperial facility openly attacked.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: It was Governor Tarkin that suggested the test.

DARTH VADER: You were not summoned here to grovel, Director Krennic.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: No, it’s...

DARTH VADER: There is no Death Star. The Senate has been informed that Jedha was destroyed in a mining disaster.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Yes, my lord.

DARTH VADER: I expect you to not rest until you can assure the Emperor that Galen Erso has not compromised this weapon in any way.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: So I’m still in command? You’ll speak to the Emperor about…

DARTH VADER: Be careful not to choke on your aspirations, Director.

SENATOR TYNNRA PAMLO: We must scatter the fleet. We have no recourse but to surrender.

BAIL ORGANA: Are we really talking about disbanding something that we’ve worked so hard to create?

ADMIRAL RADDUS: We can’t just give in.

SENATOR VASP VASPAR: We joined an Alliance, not a suicide pact!

BAIL ORGANA: We’ve only now managed to gather our forces.

SENATOR NOWER JEBEL: Gather our forces? General Draven’s already blown up an Imperial base!

GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: A decision needed to be made.

SENATOR TYNNRA PAMLO: If it’s war you want, you’ll fight alone!

SENATOR VASP VASPAR: If that’s the way it’s going, why have an Alliance at all?

ADMIRAL RADDUS: If she’s telling the truth, we need to act now!

SENATOR MON MOTHMA: Councilors, please!

ANTOC MERRICK: It is simple, the Empire has the means of mass destruction. The Rebellion does not.

SENATOR NOWER JEBEL: A Death Star, this is nonsense.

JYN ERSO: What reason would my father have to lie? What benefit would it bring him?

GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: To lure our forces into a final battle. To destroy us once and for all. SENATOR VASP VASPAR: To risk everything, based on what? The testimony of a criminal? The dying words of her father, an Imperial scientist?

SENATOR NOWER JEBEL: Don’t forget the Imperial pilot.

JYN ERSO: My father gave his life so that we may have a chance to defeat this.

GENERAL JAN DODONNA: So you’ve told us.

SENATOR TYNNRA PAMLO: If the Empire has this kind of power, what chance do we have?

JYN ERSO: What chance do we have? The question is ‘What choice?’ Run? Hide? Plead for mercy? Scatter your forces? You give way to an enemy this evil with this much power and you condemn the galaxy to an eternity of submission. The time to fight is now!

REBEL: Yes.

JYN ERSO: Every moment you waste is another step closer to the ashes of Jedha.

REBEL: What is she proposing?

REBEL: Just let the girl speak!

JYN ERSO: Send your best troops to Scarif.Send the whole rebel fleet if you have to. We need to capture the Death Star plans if there is any hope of destroying it.

SENATOR TYNNRA PAMLO: You’re asking us to invade an Imperial installation based on nothing but hope?

JYN ERSO: Rebellions are built on hope.

SENATOR VASP VASPAR: There is no hope.

ADMIRAL RADDUS: I say we fight.

SENATOR NOWER JEBEL: I say the Rebellion is finished.

SENATOR MON MOTHMA: I’m sorry, Jyn. Without the full support of the council, the odds are too great.


PA: General Syndulla, please report to the briefing room.

BAZE MALBUS: You don’t look happy.

JYN ERSO: They prefer to surrender.

BAZE MALBUS: And you?

CHIRRUT ÎMWE: She wants to fight.

BODHI ROOK: So do I. We all do.

CHIRRUT ÎMWE: The Force is strong.

JYN ERSO: I’m not sure four of us is quite enough.

BAZE MALBUS: How many do we need?

JYN ERSO: What are you talking about?

CASSIAN ANDOR: They were never going to believe you.

JYN ERSO: I appreciate the support.

CASSIAN ANDOR: But I do. I believe you. We’d like to volunteer. Some of us... ... most of us, we’ve done terrible things on behalf of the Rebellion. We’re spies. Saboteurs. Assassins. Everything I did, I did for the Rebellion. And every time I walked away from something I wanted to forget I told myself it was for a cause that I believed in. A cause that was worth it. Without that, we’re lost. Everything we’ve done would have been for nothing. I couldn’t face myself if I gave up now. None of us could. It won’t be comfortable.

BODHI ROOK: It’ll be a bit cramped, but we’ll all fit.We could go.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Okay. Gear up. Grab anything that’s not nailed down. Go, go, go!

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Jyn. I’ll be there for you. Cassian said I had to.

JYN ERSO: I’m not used to people sticking around when things go bad.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Welcome home.

PA: Bravo team to the Intelligence office for extraction mission report.


JYN ERSO: May the Force be with us.


FLIGHT CONTROLLER: Cargo shuttle, read back, please. What’s going on out there? That ship’s off limits. No one is suppose to be on board until farther instructions.


BODHI ROOK: Yes, yes we are. Affirmative.


FLIGHT CONTROLLER: That’s an impounded Imperial ship. What’s your call sign, pilot?


BODHI ROOK: Um.


JYN ERSO: We have to go.


BODHI ROOK: It-It’s um...


JYN ERSO: Say something. Come on.


BODHI ROOK: Rogue... Rogue One.


FLIGHT CONTROLLER: Rogue One? There is no Rogue One.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Well, there is now.


BODHI ROOK: Rogue One, pulling away.


K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Pulling away.

SENATOR MON MOTHMA: Despite what the others say, war is inevitable.


BAIL ORGANA: Yes, I agree. I must return to Alderaan to inform my people that there will be no peace. We will need every advantage.


SENATOR MON MOTHMA: Your friend, the Jedi.


BAIL ORGANA: He served me well during the Clone Wars and has lived in hiding since the Emperor’s purge. Yes, I will send for him.


SENATOR MON MOTHMA: You’ll need someone you can trust.


BAIL ORGANA: I would trust her with my life. Captain Antilles, I have a mission for you.


CAPTAIN RAYMUS ANTILLES: Senator.

BODHI ROOK: Okay, we’re coming in. There’s a planetwide defensive shield with a single main entry gate. This shuttle should be equipped with an access code that allows us through.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Assuming, the Empire hasn’t logged it as overdue.

BODHI ROOK: Or stolen.  JYN ERSO: And if they have?

BODHI ROOK: Then,they shut the gate and we’re all annihilated in the cold, dark vacuum of space.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Not me, I can survive in space.

BODHI ROOK: Okay. Here it goes. Cargo shuttle SW-0608 requesting a landing pad.

SHIELD GATE OFFICER: Cargo shuttle SW-0608, you’re not listed on the arrival schedule.

BODHI ROOK: Acknowledged, Gate Control. We were rerouted from Eadu Flight Station. Transmitting clearance code now.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Transmitting.

SHIELD GATE OFFICER: Cargo shuttle SW-0608? You are cleared for entry.

BODHI ROOK: Yes!

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Impressive.

JYN ERSO: I’ll tell the others.

BODHI ROOK: Okay.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER: SW-0608 clear for landing pad 9. Acknowledge, please.

BODHI ROOK: SW-0608 proceeding to LP9 as instructed.

CASSIAN ANDOR: The main building down there, what is it?

BODHI ROOK: That’s the Citadel Tower. They keep all the Imperial structure archives in there. If the plans are anywhere, they’ll be there.

CASSIAN ANDOR: The dish at the top? What’s it for?

BODHI ROOK: I guess it takes a lot of signals to send those data files out.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Landing track engaged

BODHI ROOK: Landing track locked.

CASSIAN ANDOR: We’re landing. We’re coming in!

JYN ERSO: Saw Gerrera used to say, one fighter with a sharp stick and nothing left to lose can take the day. They have no idea we’re coming. They have no reason to expect us. If we can make it to the ground, we’ll take the next chance. And the next. On and on until we win... or the chances are spent. The Death Star plans are down there. Cassian, K2, and I will find them. We’ll find a way to find them. CASSIAN ANDOR: Melshi, Pao, Baze, Chirrut, you’ll take main squad, move east and get wide of the ship. Find a position between here and the tower. Once you get to the best spot, light the place up. Make ten men feel like a hundred.

BAZE MALBUS: All right.

CASSIAN ANDOR: And get those troopers away from us.

BODHI ROOK: What should I do?

CASSIAN ANDOR: Keep the engine running. You’re our only way out of here.

STORMTROOPER: Cargo shuttle SW-0608, be prepared to receive inspection team.

JYN ERSO: Ready?

OFFICER: Hello.

BODHI ROOK: Hey, you’re probably looking for a manifest.

OFFICER: That would be helpful.

BODHI ROOK: It’s just down here.

PILOT: Director Krennic, we are entering the Scarif shield gate. General Ramda has been informed of your arrival.

BAZE MALBUS: Good luck, little sister.

BODHI ROOK: Go! Go now, you’re clear!

SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: All right, let’s go. Come on. Move, move, move.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I have a bad feeling about…

CASSIAN ANDOR: Kay!

JYN ERSO: Quiet.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: What?

CASSIAN ANDOR: We need a map.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Well, I’m sure there’s one just lying about.

CASSIAN ANDOR: You know what you have to do.

SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: One per pad. Pick your spot. We want to draw them out. I’ll call the timing. Go!

STORMTROOPER: Hey, did you hear the rumors? 

STORMTROOPER: Yeah, the T-15s have been marked obsolete.

STORMTROOPER: Oh boy, it’s about time for that.

STORMTROOPER: Hey.

STORMTROOPER: Watch out.

STORMTROOPER: What the...?

GENERAL SOTORUS RAMDA: Director, what brings you to Scarif?

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Galen Erso, I want every dispatch, every transmission he has ever sent called up for inspection.

GENERAL SOTORUS RAMDA: All of them?

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Yes. All of them. Get started.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Kay?

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Our optimal route to the data vault places only 89 stormtroopers in our path. We will make it no more than 33% of the way before we are killed.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Melshi, talk to me.

SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: Ready, ready. Standing by.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Light it up.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Are we blind? Deploy the garrison! Move!

CORPORAL STORDAN TONC: Troopers! Troopers. Troopers on the left!

GENERAL HURST ROMODI: Sir? Scarif base, they’re reporting a rebel incursion.

GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: I want to speak to Director Krennic.

GENERAL HURST ROMODI: He’s there, sir. On Scarif.

GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: The original plans for this station are kept there, are they not?

GENERAL HURST ROMODI: They are.

GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: Prepare for the jump to hyperspace and inform Lord Vader.

OFFICER: Can I help you?

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: That won’t be necessary.

REBEL: Senator! Senator.

GENERAL ANTOC MERRICK: Stop right there, Private.

SENATOR MON MOTHMA: Let him speak.

REBEL: Intercepted Imperial transmission, ma’am. Rebels on Scarif.

SENATOR MON MOTHMA: I need to speak to Admiral Raddus.

REBEL: He’s returned to his ship. He’s gone to fight.

REBEL: No!

PA: Attention all flight personnel,please report to your commanders immediately. Attention all flight personnel, please report to your commanders immediately. We have been redirected to Scarif. Pilots, you’ll be briefed by your squadron leaders on route. May the Force be with you.

C-3PO [SEE-THREEPIO]: Scarif? They’re going to Scarif? Why does nobody ever tell me anything, Artoo?

R2-D2 [ARTOO-DETOO]: [R2 beeps]

C-3PO [SEE-THREEPIO]: Yeah, nobody tells us anything.

SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: Fall back! Fall back!

CHIRRUT ÎMWE: Keep drawing them out!

SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: Go. Go. Move. Move.Come on, move up!

IMPERIAL: Pad 12 report to ground. Coming at our flank, we’re outnumbered.

IMPERIAL: Pad 12 team, what’s going on down there? Status, please. All Pads report in immediately.

IMPERIAL: Unknown, we have rebels everywhere.

IMPERIAL: We’re taking fire, Pad 12, Pad 14 request assistance.

BODHI ROOK: This is Pad 2, Pad 2. I spot 40 rebels heading west on Pad 2. Get on there, tell him pinned down by rebels on Pad 5.

CORPORAL STORDAN TONC: This is Pad 5, we’re being overrun. Help us!

CASSIAN ANDOR: This is not working, Kay.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Right hand.

CHIRRUT ÎMWE: Baze! Baze!

BAZE MALBUS: What?

CHIRRUT ÎMWE: Run!

REBEL: Retreat. Retreat!

ADMIRAL RADDUS: This is Admiral Raddus of the Rebel Alliance. All Squadron leaders report in.

GENERAL ANTOC MERRICK: Admiral, this is Blue Leader standing by.

JON VANDER (GOLD LEADER): This is Gold Leader, standing by.

GARVEN DREIS (RED LEADER): This is Red Leader, standing by.

IMPERIAL CREW MEMBER: Sir, those are rebel ships.

IMPERIAL LIEUTENANT: Get Admiral Gorin, immediately.

LIEUTENANT MYTUS ADEMA: Director, the rebel fleet, it’s amassing outside the shield.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Lock down the base. Lock down.

LIEUTENANT MYTUS ADEMA: And close the shield?

LIEUTENANT ORSON KRENNIC: Do it!

ADMIRAL RADDUS: Red and Gold squadron, attack formations. Defend the fleet. Blue squadron, get to the surface before they closed that gate.

GENERAL ANTOC MERRICK: Copy, your Admiral. Blue squadron, on me.

BARION RANER (BLUE FOUR): Copy, Blue Leader.

FARNS MONSBEE (BLUE FIVE): Copy, Blue Leader.

HEFF TOBBER (BLUE EIGHT): We won’t have long.

SHIELD GATE OFFICER: Close the field aperture now. Close it!

VANGOS GREK (BLUE SIX): Come on, come on, come on!

BARION RANER (BLUE FOUR): Pull up!

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Rebel fleet has arrived.

JYN ERSO: What?

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: There’s fighting on the beach, they’ve locked down the base, they’ve closed the shield gate.

JYN ERSO: What does that mean? We’re trapped?

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: We could transmit the plans to the rebel fleet. We’d have to get a signal out to tell them it’s coming. It’s the size of the data files. That’s the problem.They’ll never get through. Someone has to take that shield gate down.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Bodhi. Bodhi, can you hear me? Bodhi, tell me you’re out there. Bodhi!

BODHI ROOK: Hello, I’m here. We’re standing by. They’ve started fighting, the base is on lockdown!

CASSIAN ANDOR: I know, listen to me! The rebel fleet is up there. You’ve got to tell them to blow a hole in the shield gate so we can transmit the plans.

BODHI ROOK: Wait, I can’t. I’m not hooked into the comm tower. We’re not tied in.

CASSIAN ANDOR: It’s the only way we’re getting them out of here. Find a way! Cover our backs.

JYN ERSO: You’ll need this. You wanted one, right?

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Your behavior, Jyn Erso, is continually unexpected.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Jyn. Come on.

AT-AT PILOT: Fire on my command.

BAZE MALBUS: Look!

BODHI ROOK: Get ready. We’re going to have to go out there.

REBEL: What’re you doing?

BODHI ROOK: They closed the shield gate, we’re stuck here. But, the rebel fleet is pulling in.We just have to get a signal strong enough to get through to them and let them know we’re trapped down here. For that, we have to connect to the communications tower. Now, I can patch us in over here, the landing pad but you have to get on the radio, get one of the guys out there to find a master switch. Get them to activate the connection between us and that comm tower. REBEL: Okay.

BODHI ROOK: Then go!

ADMIRAL RADDUS: What’s going on down there, Lieutenant?

LIEUTENANT: Unknown, sir. We can’t raise them. All rebel frequencies are blocked.

ADMIRAL RADDUS: Keep trying. Engage those Star Destroyers and let’s start probing that shield.

LIEUTENANT: Yes, sir. GARVEN DREIS (RED LEADER): We’re going in.

GARVEN DREIS (RED LEADER): Stay with me.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Schematics bank, Data tower two.

CASSIAN ANDOR: How do I find that?

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Searching. I can locate the tape, but you’ll need the handles for extraction.

CASSIAN ANDOR: What are we supposed to do with these? Whoa.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Well, finally.

STORMTROOPER: Wait, stop.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: The rebels! They went over there.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Kay. What’s going on out there?

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: There’s one. Oh well.

RED PILOT: Come on!

JON VANDER (GOLD LEADER): Red Leader, this is Gold Leader, we’re starting our attack run on the shield gate. Keep it tight and watch out for those towers.

GOLD PILOT: More fighters. Form up, at 65.

LIEUTENANT: Sir, enemy fighters coming in.

CORPORAL STORDAN TONC: Melshi. Melshi, come in, are you there? Bodhi will send a signal from here. He’s patching us in. But you guys have to open up a line for the tower.

SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: How? Please advise.

CORPORAL STORDAN TONC: There’s a master switch to the base of the Comm tower.

SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: Master switch, describe, what are we looking for?

CORPORAL STORDAN TONC: What does it look like? The master switch? Where is it?

GENERAL ANTOC MERRICK: Two wings, reinforce those troops on the beach. All fighters, on me. We have to shield them from air attack.

LAREN JOMA (BLUE ELEVEN): Troop reinforcements.

REBEL MARINE: Here we go. For Jedha!

MARINE: Jedha!

RED PILOT: We're having no effect on that shield.

BLUE PILOT: How much more can that thing take?

GARVEN DREIS (RED LEADER): Stick close, Red 5, where are you going?

PEDRIN GUAL (RED FIVE): I’m trying to lose them. This is Red 5, I need help!

JYN ERSO: Hyperspace Tracking, Navigational Systems.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Two screens down. Structural engineering, open that one!

CASSIAN ANDOR: What?

JYN ERSO: Stardust. That’s it.

CASSIAN ANDOR: How do you know that?

JYN ERSO: I know because it’s me.

STORMTROOPER: Hey, you. Identify yourself.

BODHI ROOK: I can explain.

STORMTROOPER: Incoming fire, take cover!

CASSIAN ANDOR: Kay, we need the file for Stardust!

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Stardust.

JYN ERSO: That’s it.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Kay.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Climb. Climb. You can still send the plans to the fleet. If they open the shield gate, you can broadcast from the tower! Locking the vault door now.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Kay. Kay!

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Good bye.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Kay!

LIEUTENANT MYTUS ADEMA: Sir, unauthorized access at the data vault.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: What? 

LIEUTENANT MYTUS ADEMA: It’s just come in, sir.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Send my guard squadron into battle! Two men with me now! Get that beach under control!

CASSIAN ANDOR: Bodhi? Are you there? Have you got the switch?

BODHI ROOK: I can’t get to the shuttle, I can’t plug in!

CASSIAN ANDOR: You have to! They have to hit that gate. If the shield’s open, we can send the plans!

BLUE: General, behind you!

REBEL: Take them out.


JYN ERSO: Step back.


BLUE ELEVEN: We’re going down!

REBEL: Come on! Look out.

BODHI ROOK: Melshi. Melshi, come in please.

SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: I’m tied in at my end, I just need an open line. Hang on. The master switch, it’s over at that console. I’m going!

JYN ERSO: I’ve got it.

CASSIAN ANDOR: Careful! You okay?

CASSIAN ANDOR: Jyn!

CHIRRUT ÎMWE: I’m one with the Force and the Force is with me. I’m one with the Force and the Force is with me.

LIEUTENTANT: Deflector shield’s down to 50%, we’re sustaining heavy damage.

ADMIRAL RADDUS: There’s no turning back now, we have to press the attack.

GOLD LEADER: Hit that opening.

GOLD NINE: We see it, Gold Leader. Ion torpedoes away.

STAR DESTROYER CAPTAIN: What’s happening?

IMPERIAL CREW MEMBER: We’ve lost engine power, sir.

ADMIRAL RADDUS: That Star Destroyer is disabled.

BODHI ROOK: This is Rogue One, calling any Alliance ships that can hear me! Is there anybody up there? This is Rogue One! Come in, over.

ADMIRAL RADDUS: This is Admiral Raddus, Rogue One, we hear you!

BODHI ROOK: We have the plans! They found the Death Star plans. They have to transmit them from the communications tower! You have to take down the shield gate. It’s the only way to going to get them through!

ADMIRAL RADDUS: Call up a Hammerhead corvette. I have an idea. Standby, Rogue One, we’re on it.

BODHI ROOK: This is for you, Galen.

BAZE MALBUS: The Force is with me. I’m one with the Force.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Who are you?

JYN ERSO: You know who I am. I’m Jyn Erso. Daughter of Galen and Lyra. You’ve lost.

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Oh, I have, have I?

JYN ERSO: My father’s revenge. He built a flaw in the Death Star. He put a fuse in the middle of your machine and I’ve just told the entire galaxy how to light it. DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: The shield is up, your signal will never reach the rebel base. All the ships in here will be destroyed. I lose nothing but time. YOU on the other hand die with the Rebellion.

COMPUTER: Transmitting. Transmitting.

GENERAL HURST ROMODI: Sir, shall I begin targeting their fleet?

GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: Lord Vader will handle the fleet. Target the base at Scarif. Single reactor ignition.

GENERAL HURST ROMODI: Yes, sir.

GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: You may fire when ready. GENERAL HURST ROMODI: Commence primary ignition.

ADMIRAL RADDUS: Rogue One, may the Force be with you. All ships, prepare for jump to hyperspace!

JYN ERSO: I’m glad you came. CASSIAN ANDOR: You father would have been proud of you, Jyn.

CAPTAIN SHAEF CORSSIN: The rebel flag ship is disabled, my lord, but has received transmission from the surface.

DARTH VADER: Prepare a boarding party.

CAPTAIN SHAEF CORSSIN: Yes, my lord.

REBEL: Hurry! REBEL 2: Let’s go! REBEL 1: We got to go now. REBEL: Hurry, let’s go.
